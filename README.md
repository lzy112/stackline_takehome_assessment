# Data Analyst Assessment

## Overview

This repo has solutions for two questions on sales data analysis and optimization.

## Files

- `Question1_Solution.ipynb`: Analyzes sales data to find the best prices for Product A and Product B.
- `Question2_Solution.ipynb`: Analyzes which website-product combo converts the most visitors into sales.

## Question 1: Optimal Selling Price

### What I Did

1. Loaded and cleaned the sales data.
2. Plotted the sales vs. price for both products.
3. Fitted polynomial regression models to understand the relationship.
4. Calculated total revenue for different prices and identified the price that maximizes revenue.

### How to Run

1. Open `Question1_Solution.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells in order to see data exploration, plotting, model fitting, and revenue optimization.
3. The notebook will show the best prices at the end.

## Question 2: Sales Conversion

### What I Did

1. Created a DataFrame with sales data for three products on Amazon, Walmart, and Target.
2. Added visitor ratios for each website.
3. Calculated sales per visitor.
4. Found the best website-product combo based on sales per visitor.

### How to Run

1. Open `Question2_Solution.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells in order to see data prep, calculation, and the best combo identification.
3. The notebook will show the optimal combos at the end.
